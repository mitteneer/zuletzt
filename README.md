# Zuletzt
**Zuletzt** gives you the statistics of your music listening habits.

Inspired by Last.fm, Maloja, and Lastfmstats.com.


**Z**uletzt is written in **Z**ig as a means of learning the
language, reintroducing myself to programming, and combining
the functionality of the aforementioned inspirations.

Zuletzt means "last" in German.
