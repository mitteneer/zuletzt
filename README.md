# Zuletzt
**Zuletzt** gives you the statistics of your music listening habits.

Inspired by [Last.fm](https://last.fm), [Maloja](https://github.com/krateng/maloja), and [Lastfmstats.com](https://www.lastfmstats.com).


**Z**uletzt is written with [**Z**ig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig) and [Jetzig](https://github.com/jetzig-framework/jetzig) as a means of learning the
language, reintroducing myself to programming, and combining
the functionality of the aforementioned inspirations.

Zuletzt means "last" in German.
